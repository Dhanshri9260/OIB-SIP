      <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdule Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 – 27 July
            2015) was an  Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India (2002–2007).
            Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become one of India’s 
            most respected scientists and leaders. He studied physics and later specialized in 
            aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam played a key 
            role in India’s space and missile development programs. As a scientist at DRDO and ISRO, 
            he contributed significantly to the development of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle 
            (SLV-III) and ballistic missile technology, earning him the title “Missile Man of India.” 
            He also played an important role in the 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests, strengthening India’s 
            defense capabilities. In 2002, he became the President of India and was widely known as the 
            “People’s President” because of his simplicity, humility, and deep connection with students 
            and young people. Even after his presidency, he continued teaching, writing, and inspiring youth 
            to dream big and work hard for the nation. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam passed away on 27 July 2015 
            while delivering a lecture, doing what he loved most — teaching. He remains an enduring symbol 
            of knowledge, leadership, and inspiration for millions.
